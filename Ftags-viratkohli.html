        <p>
            Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi
            Hindu
            family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked as
            a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a
            housewife.
            He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older
            sister, Bhawna. Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar.
            He
            commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti
            Public School. According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early
            affinity for cricket as a mere three-year-old. He
            would pick up a cricket bat, display natural skill, and request his
            father to bowl to him.n 1998, the West Delhi
            Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem
            Kohli,
            who'd espoused his younger son's fervour for
            cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for
            him
            to meet Rajkumar Sharma. Upon the
            suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling
            his
            son in a professional cricket academy, as
            they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just
            playing in gully cricket.[12] Despite his
            abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in
            the
            under-14 Delhi team, supposedly due to
            extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedely received offers to
            relocate
            his son to influential clubs, which would
            have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli
            eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi
            team.

                Career - Wikipedia</a>
        </h2><p>
            2008-2009: Debut and maiden stint
            In August 2008, Kohli was included in the ODl squad for the tour of
            Sri
            Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan.
            Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited experience, with
            only
            eight List A matches under his belt. So, his
            selection was considered a "surprise call-up". During the Sri Lankan
            tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin
            Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, were unable to play due to injury,
            Kohli
            was required to fill the role of makeshift
            opener throughout the series. On August 18, 2008, Kohli made his
            international debut at the age of 19 in the first
            ODI of the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in
            front by an incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara.
            However, in the fourth match of the series, Kohli scored his
            inaugural
            half century in the ODl format, with a total
            of fifty-four runs scored.Following the postponement of the
            Champions
            Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a
            replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for
            the
            unofficial Tests against Australia A in
            September 2008. Despite limited opportunities, he managed to make an
            impact in the single innings that he
            participated in, scoring 49 runs.In October 2008, Kohli participated
            in
            a four-day tour match against Australia as
            part of the Indian Board President's XI team. The match featured a
            formidable Australian bowling line-up that
            consisted of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle
            and
            Jason Krejza. Despite this, Kohli displayed
            his batting prowess by scoring 105 runs in the first innings and an
            unbeaten 16 runs in the second innings,
            demonstrating his ability to perform against high-level
            international
            competition.
