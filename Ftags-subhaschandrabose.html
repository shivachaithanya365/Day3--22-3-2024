            <b>Subhas Chandra Bose</b> (23 January 1897 - 18 August 1945) was an
            Indian nationalist whose defiance of British
            authority in India made him a <mark>hero</mark> among many Indians,
            but
            his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and
            Imperial Japan left a legacy vexed by <u>authoritarianism,
                anti-Semitism,</u> and military failure. The honorific
            <i>'Netaji' (Bengali: "Respected Leader")</i> was first applied to
            Bose
            in Germany in early 1942â€”by the Indian
            soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian
            officials
            in the <u>Special Bureau for India</u> in
            Berlin. It is now used throughout India.
            Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in
            Orissa during the British Raj. The early
            recipient of an Anglo-centric education, after college he was sent
            to
            England to take the <del>Indian Civil Service
                examination</del>. He <q>succeeded with distinction in the first
                exam</q>. but demurred at taking the routine
            final exam, citing nationalism as a higher calling. Returning to
            India
            in 1921, Bose joined the nationalist movement
            led by Mahatma Gandhi and the <a
                href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subhas_Chandra_Bose>Indian
                National
                Congress.</a> He followed Jawaharlal Nehru to leadership in a
            group
            within the Congress which was less keen on
            constitutional reform and more open to socialism.[i] Bose became
            Congress president in 1938. After reelection in
            1939, differences arose between him and the Congress leaders,
            including
            Gandhi, over the future federation of
            British India and princely states, but also because discomfort had
            grown
            among the Congress leadership over Bose's
            negotiable attitude to non-violence, and his plans for greater
            powers
            for himself. After the large majority of the
            Congress Working Committee members resigned in protest, Bose
            resigned as
            president and was eventually ousted from
            the party.
