        team and was the captain of the side in limited-overs formats from

            Profile</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Less than thirty years before that enchanting Saturday night when
        Ravi Shastri's voice rang through television
        sets all over India, when even the spunky and exuberant Indian youth
        showed more interest in an old-school CRT
        television at a local chai ki dukaan than the dance-floor at a pub,
        a pump-operator in Ranchi awaited the birth
        of his third child.Any cricket fan worth his salt just read this in
        Ravi Shastri's most dramatic voice, as
        Mahendra Singh Dhoni enchanted the Wankhede on the night of 2nd
        April 2011.MS Dhoni and Chennai Super Kings is a
        great yellove story. Ever since the Indian Premier League idea
        spread vigorously among the cricketing
        fraternity, people wondered which team would pouch the then Indian
        captain. The Super Kings, run by an
        organisation that knew the nuances of running sports, knew they
        wanted a strong leader to lay a strong base and
        they made a grand opening by bagging Dhoni for a whopping 6 Crore,
        the highest bid back then. The IPL would be
        born on April 18, 2008 and on June 1, Dhoni was there leading CSK in
        the final, albeit in a losing cause in a
        final-ball finish.
        <mark><b>'Dhoniiiii finishes off in style. A magnificent strike into
                the crowd. India lift the World Cup after 28 years. The
                party's started in the dressing room. And it's
                an
                Indian captain, who's been absolutely magnificent, in the
                night of the final.'</b></mark>
